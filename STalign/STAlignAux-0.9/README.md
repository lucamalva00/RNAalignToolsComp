# Installation

Download the following files from folder `download` at 
<https://github.com/bdslab/STAlign/> - Direct link: 
<https://github.com/bdslab/STAlign/tree/master/download>

1. `STAlign.jar` - executable jar of of the basic STAlign comparison tool 
2. `STAlignWorkbench.jar` - executable jar of of the STAlign workbench comparator
3. `STAlignAux-vx.zip` - auxiliary file of the last version of STAlign

and put them in any position of your drive. 

Unzip the file `STAlignAux-vx.zip` with the facilities of your operating system. 
The folder `STAlignAux-<VersionNumber>` is created containing the following files:

- STAlign-config.txt --- default STAlign configuration file
- STAlign-config-alternative.txt --- alternative STAlign configuration file
- examples --- folder containing sample input and output files
- INSTALL.md--- information on STAlign installation
- README.md --- STAlign description and usage information
- COPYING.txt --- copyright information
- LICENSE --- full GNU GPL Version 3 License
- CHANGELOG.txt --- information about the evolution of STAlign versions

The executable jar files runs on every Linux, Windows and Mac OS platform
in which a Java SE Runtime Environment 8 is installed. 

For information and installing the Java Runtime Environment see
<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>

## Accepted Input file formats 

* PDB format <https://www.rcsb.org/>
* Arc Annotated Sequence: includes the sequence (optional) and the bonds, 
expressed as a list `(i_1,j_1);(i_2,j_2); ... ;(i_m,j_m)` where each index 
`i_k, j_k` belongs to the interval `[1,n]` where `n` is the length
of the primary sequence and `i_k < j_k`  for all `k`.

## STAlign.jar usage examples

* `> java -jar STAlign.jar -sc 1o0b -o 1o0b.txt`

Produce file `1o0b.txt` containing the linearised tree text of the structural tree
corresponding to the PDB molecule with code `1o0b`.

* `> java -jar STAlign.jar -d -af examples/tRNA/1o0b.pdb examples/tRNA/1o0c.pdb`

Print on the standard output the ASA distance between the two structural trees 
derived from the given PDB files.

See folder `examples` for some sample input files in both notations
coming from public databases or from the paper

## Output formats

Default output format is a linearised tree description of the form 

`("node-label", [list-of-children])`

An alternative output format is `LaTeX` code that can be processed with 
LaTeX to produce a graphical representation of the tree in a pdf file.
LaTeX format should be used for relative small structures, otherwise
the pdf file may not be produced or may be not readable.  

Default output stream is Standard Output. Output can be sent to a file 
using option -o 

## Configuration

The costs for the basic operations of alignment are specified in the default
configuration file `STAlign-config.txt`. The values can be changed directly 
in this file or by using a different configuration file specified with 
option -n. The default configuration file must reside in the same folder in 
which the command is launched, while the file specified with option -n 
can reside in any folder.

## STAlignWorkbench.jar usage examples

* `> java -jar STAlignWorkbench.jar -f examples/tRNA`

Processes all the files in folder `tRNA`. Each file is read as a
PDB file or Arc Annotated Sequence format. Comma-separated values files 
`STAlignProcessedStructures.csv` and
`STAlignComparisonResults.csv` are created in the folder
"`tRNA`". The former contains the description of all the
biomolecules that were found and correctly processed. The latter contains,
for each pair of processed biomolecules, the ASA Distance between the two
correspondig structural trees and execution time information.

* `>java -jar STAlignWorkbench.jar -f examples/tRNA -o stucts.csv cmpr.csv -n my-config.txt`

Processes all the files in folder `tRNA` as above but produce
the description of processed structures in file `structs.csv` and
comparison results in file `cmpr.csv`. Instead of using
`STAling-config.txt` default configuration file, use `my-config.txt` as
configuration file.

See folder [examples](examples) for further examples of use.

## Using STAlign

Open a terminal window of your operating system and use the change directory 
(cd) command to move to a folder in which the executable jar(s) and the
configuration file(s) were placed. To launch the basic STAlign comparator 
digit:

`> java -jar STAlign.jar <options>`

The following <options> can be used:

## Using STAlignWorkbench

Open a terminal window of your operating system and use the change directory 
(cd) command to move to a folder in which the executable jar(s) and the
configuration file(s) were placed. To launch the basic STAlignWorkbench 
comparator digit:

`> java -jar STAlignWorkbench.jar <options>`

The following <options> can be used:

	-cm,--centerofmass                            Calculate the distance
                                                  matrix with center of
                                                  mass method
	-e,--showscores                               Show current values of
                                                  edit scores used for
                                                  alignment
	-edf,--editdistanceinput <input-folder>       Process the files in the
                                                  given folder and
                                                  calculate edit distance
	-edfm,--editdistanceinputcustom <input-folder> Process the bond files
                                                  in the given folder and
                                                  calculate edit distance
	-f,--input <input-folder>                     Process the files in the
                                                  given folder
	-fm,--inputcustom <input-folder>              Process the bond files
                                                  in the given folder
	-h,--help                                     Show usage information
	-i,--info                                     Show license and other
                                                  info
	-n,--useconffile <conf-file>                  Use the specified
                                                  configuration file
                                                  instead of the default
                                                  one
	-o,--output <file-1 file-2>                   Output structure
                                                  descriptions on file-1
                                                  and comparison results
                                                  on file-2 instead of
                                                  generating the default
                                                  ouput files
	-t,--threshold <threshold>                    Set a threshold
