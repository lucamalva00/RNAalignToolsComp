CRITERIA USED TO GENERATE BASE-PAIR: 
  3.40 --> upper H-bond length limits (ON..ON).
 26.00 --> max. distance between paired base origins.
  2.50 --> max. vertical distance between paired base origins.
 65.00 --> max. angle between paired bases [0-90].
  5.40 --> min. distance between RN9/YN1 atoms.
  8.00 --> max. distance criterion for helix break[0-12]
-----------------------------------------------------------
BASE-PAIR INSTRUCTIONS: 
Column 1 is rnaview assigned base numbers n1_n2, start from 1.
Column 2 & 3 are chain ID & residue number in input PDB file.
Column 4 is for base pair. The left & right are the bases as 
         identified by column 2 & 3 and 5 & 6.
Column 5 & 6 are residue number & chain ID in input PDB file.
Column 7 is for base pair annotation. The standard Watson-Crick
         (W.C.) pairs are annotated as -/- (AU,AT) or +/+ (GC).
         Other pairs are annotated as Leontis_Westhof Classification.
         The three edges: W(Watson-Crick); H(Hoogsteen); S(suger).
         e.g. W/H means the pair is edge of Watson-Crick & Hoogsteen.
Column 8 is glycosidic bond orientation (either cis or trans).
         e.g. 'W/H cis' means the pair is interaction on Watson-Crick
         and Hoogsteen side, glycosidic bond orientation is 'cis'.
Column 9 corresponds to Saenger Classification.

Other columns: 
        Syn sugar-base conformations are annotated as (syn).
        Stacked base pairs are annotated as (stack).
        Non-identified edges are annotated as (.) or (?)
        Tertiary interactions are marked by (!) in the line.
