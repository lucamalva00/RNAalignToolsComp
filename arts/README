---------------------------------------------------------------------	

Installation:
-------------

To install, simply open the archive anywhere.

---------------------------------------------------------------------	

Quick start:
------------ 

1. Input: 
	- PDB format files for the two Nucleic Acids you wish to align.
	- For each PDB file, the user has to supply a file containing
	the list of all base-pairs. If the name of the PDB file is 
	x.pdb, then the name of the base-pair file should be x.pairs.
	The format describing a base-pair is:
	<chain>:<residue>-<chain>:<residue>.
  	Here is an example for a base-pair file:
	# FORMAT: <chain>:<residue>-<chain>:<residue>
	B:1-B:47
	B:2-B:46
	B:3-B:45
	B:4-B:44
	B:5-B:43
	B:6-B:42
	B:8-B:41
	B:9-B:40
	B:11-B:39
	B:12-B:38
	
	Note: The ARTS package contains a script named
	'parse3DNABasePairs.pl' for parsing a base-pair file generated
	by the 3DNA program
	(http://rutchem.rutgers.edu/~xiangjun/3DNA/) to the format
	required by ARTS.  

2. Running arts
	* Pairwise Alignment:
	The command line is 'arts <PDB file path> <PDB file path>'
	Note that the the base pairs file (the '.pairs' files) for each
	PDB file should be located under the same path.

	* DB Search
	The command line is 'arts <PDB file path> -d <DB file>'
	The DB file contains a line for each DB molecule with its name
	and the path for its PDB file (separated by a ';'). For
	example
	17ra ; 17ra.pdb  
	1b36:A ; 1b36A.pdb 
	104d:AB ; 104d_1.pdb
	 
        Note that the the base pairs file (the '.pairs' files) for
	each PDB file should be located under the same path.	

3. Output: 
	The output is a file named 'arts.out'. This file outlines all
	the top-ranking alignments found by arts (the format of the file is
	explained below).  

4. Use arts2pdb to create PDB files of a specific alignment. 
	The command line is: arts2pdb arts.out <alignment number> 
	By executing this command, several PDB files decribing the
	alignment and viewer scripts are created. These files are
	furhter explained below.  	

5. Use a viewer to view the alignments
	Note: scripts are available for RasMol and PyMol (described
	below)  

---------------------------------------------------------------------	

Configuration:
--------------

The default configuration file is located under the ARTS folder (where
all the executable files and scripts) and its name is "arts.config". 

In addition, arts can get as an input in the command line a
configuration file that is specific for the run (by using the "-c" 
flag in the command line, see below).

---------------------------------------------------------------------	

The rest of this document explains the tools in the ARTS package in depth. 

List of Tools:
--------------

The tools that would be described are:
1. arts -      		
	The main application, which run ARTS algorithm
2. parse3DNABasePairs.pl - 
	A script for parsing a base-pair file generated
	by the 3DNA program
	(http://rutchem.rutgers.edu/~xiangjun/3DNA/) to 
	the format required by ARTS.
3. arts2pdb - 
	A utility for creating several PDB files where the molecules
	are aligned.  

1. arts
--------

A. Command line format:

arts <PDB file path> <PDB file path> <options>

The options in the command line are:
  -c, --config=configuration file     configuration file. If not
                                      specified, the default
                                      parameters are used. 

  -o, --output=output file            output file. If not specified,
                                      the output will be printed into
                                      a file named arts.out


B. Input:

In other words, arts expects two files for each molecule:
1. A PDB file. 
2. A file decribing the list of all base-pairs. 
   If the name of the PDB file is x.pdb, then the name of the
   base-pair file should be x.pairs. The format describing a
   base-pair is: 
   <chain>:<residue>-<chain>:<residue>.
   Here is an example for a base-pair file:
   # FORMAT: <chain>:<residue>-<chain>:<residue>
   B:1-B:47
   B:2-B:46
   B:3-B:45
   B:4-B:44
   B:5-B:43
   B:6-B:42
   B:8-B:41
   B:9-B:40
   B:11-B:39
   B:12-B:38

C. Output:

By default, arts creates an output file named arts.out in the
directory from which it has been run. This file summarises the
top-ranking alignments arts has found. 

Log entries and progress messages go to the standard output. 

The output file has 5 parts: 
1. The configuration parameters that were used for this run of arts.
2. General information about the molecules that have been loaded
   (e.g. names, number of nucleotides).
3. Runtime in a HH:MM:SS format
4. A table that lists the top-ranking alignment arts has found. Each
   alignment has an ID. This ID can be used to find a more detailed
   information about the alignment down the file.
5. The rest of the file gives detailed description about each
   top-ranking alignment:
   - Score (a weighted sum of the nucleotides and base pairs in the
     core) 
   - Core Size (the number of nucleotides in the core)
   - Number of Conserved Base Pairs (the nuber of base pairs in the core)
   - RMSD (between the matched nucleotides in the core)
   - Number Of Identical Core Residues (the number of matched
     nucleotides with the same base type)
   - Structural Identity (the core size devided by the size of the
     smallest input molecules)
   - Core Sequence Identity (core base identity, that is the number of
     identicore residues devided by the core size)
   - Sequential Match Score (a score defined by the number of
     consecutive nucleotides in the core)
   - Molecules (the first molecule is the pivot and the second
     molecule is superimposed on the pivot)  		
   - The transformations that superimpose the second molecule onto the
     first one (the pivot)
   - The match list that describes the core of the alignment. Each
     entry contains the nucleotides that arts has matched between the
     molecules. 

D. Customizing
If a configuration file is supplied in the command line (by using -c
option), arts uses this file. Otherwise, arts uses the default
configuration (defined in a file named 'arts.config' and is supposed
to be located at the same directory as arts).


3. arts2pdb
------------

Use this utility when you wish to view one of the alignments, obtained
by arts. 

A. Command line format

arts2pdb <arts output file> <alignment number>

B. Output

The utility creates the following PDB files.
- A PDB file named 'fullAlignment.pdb': When loading this file into a
viewer, the alignened molecules will be shown completely. 
- A PDB file named 'referenceAlignment': When loading this file into a
viewer, the reference molecule will be shown completely. For the
second molecule, only its core, superimposed on the first molecule,
will be displayed 
- A PDB file named 'coreAlignment': When loading this file into a
viewer, only the core of the alignment will be shown. 
- A PDB file for each structure after applying the transformation. The
namese of these PDB files start with 'model1' and 'model2' for the
first and second molecules repsectively.

In addition, the utility creates:
- a Rasmol script, named 'script_fullAlignment.rsm'. This script loads
the 'full_alignment.pdb file' and defines the core of the alignment. 
To use this script execute: 
<your rasmol command> -script full_alignment.pdb
Then, in the prompt of the Rasmol viewer, one can select the core of
the alignment ('select core') and manipulates it.

- a PyMOL script, named 'script_fullAlignment.pml'. The script loads
the PDB files of the two molecules after applying the transformation
(the two model PDB files) and define the common core. Then, in the
prompt of the PyMOL viewer, one can select the core of the alignment
and manipulates it. 

- A text file, named 'match.txt' that contains details about the
alignment.
